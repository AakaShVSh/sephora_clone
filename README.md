I hope you like the snippets of our site, but I would like to take you to the part about what are the difficulties we actually face, one of the difficulties is to merge all the data together, and GITHUB was new to all of us, managing that took a lot of time and proper communication helps us to work with each other and I would each member is the team is supportive towards each other. finally there are a scripting that we have used here are taken from the following sites,
some extra tool are used to make the website look good.

Closure
Problems we face apart from data collection, CSS plays an important role in any site as we are not UI libraries CSS was the only key to making our website look alike as the real one, but with the help of various websites we are able to do that and also Local Storage part is challenging, but with proper coordination, we did it, kudos to all members and I hope we are gonna make 100s of the project in the upcoming time.
